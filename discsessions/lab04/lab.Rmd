# R Markdown

## R Markdown

- R Markdown is an excellent way of combining text and code.

- They look ugly, but they compile well.

- The problem sets and final are all done in R Markdown.

- The main advantage of R Markdown is that it makes the code reproducible:
  + I do not need to believe you to recheck your work.

## R Markdown

- Compiles into three formats: `HTML`, `PDF`, or `DOCX`. 
  + Of these three formats, you can only do `HTML` without installing extra software.
  + But you only need `HTML`! The `HTML` also has the advantage of being easy to customize.
  
- If you ever want to build a `PDF`, *Google* how to install something called `tinytex`.
  
- But how does R Markdown work?

## R Markdown

- To get started with an R Markdown, go to \fu{File > New File > R Markdown...}.

- It shows the image below. For now, click \fu{OK}\ to proceed.

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../../images/rmd1.png}\end{center}

## R Markdown

It creates a default R Markdown for you to get started, as you can see below.

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../../images/rmd2.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown

- To get started, we are going to compile the Markdown. 

- Compiling transforms the `.Rmd` into a report in the format you asked it to do.
  + For this class, it is going to be `HTML`.

- We compile by running the Knit command. But don't click there yet!

- Before clicking, a quick detour...

# Quick Detour - Packages

## Packages

- Your R is good but not that powerful.

- The power of R is that many people worldwide can build R code and share.

- People do that by building `packages`. Think of packages as the R supplements.

- If you go to the gym and take whey to grow muscle, your R does the same by downloading and running packages.

- Each package was built to solve a particular problem. By having a problem, you can google a package that solves it.

## Install Packages

- To install a package, you need to run the following:

```
install.packages('name_of_the_package')
```

- And [here is a list of packages in the R repo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).

- There are almost 20k packages by now! Go ahead and run:

```
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

- Tidyverse is a family of packages useful for data analysis.

## Loading Packages

- Once done installing, the package is downloaded but not *loaded* in the memory.

- R does not load packages automatically because, for each loaded package, you eat up a small amount of the computer's memory.

- So you need to ask R to load it. To load the tidyverse family, we do the following:

```
library('tidyverse')
```

- And now you have it there.

## Packages

Two important facts about packages:

1. You just need to **install** a package **once**. After installing, it is in your computer. You may need to update it, but that's not frequent.

2. You **always** need to **load** the packages you are using. Get into the habit of running `library(tidyverse)` first thing when you open the computer.

Also important:

**Don't be afraid of installing new packages. It is like giving vitamins and minerals to your R.**

# Back to R Markdown

## R Markdown

- Compiling transforms the `.Rmd` into a report in the format you asked it to do.

- We compile by running the Knit button (\includegraphics[height=.07\textheight]{../../images/rmdknitbutton.png})

- Now go ahead and click there! If you did not use the command before, it will install a few packages.

- Then, it is going to ask to save the file. Save as `lab04.Rmd`, in a folder you will remember later.

- Once done, you should go to the folder and see the `lab04.Rmd` and another file, `lab04.html`. 
  + The `HTML` is a file you can open in your internet browser!
  
- Now let's learn each of the parts of an R Markdown file

## R Markdown - YAML

- `YAML` (or Yet Another Markup Language, hahaha): This is the head of your document.

- This part gives the instructions regarding what type of document you want and more.

- We are not covering it here, but an advanced user should be aware of these tools.

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../../images/rmdyaml.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown - YAML

- `YAML`: My suggestion is to keep it simple:
  + `output: html_document`. Don't change unless required.
  + `title: `: Add the title to your document unless already done.
  + `date: `: You can write a date. Note that I do an R command that generates the date automatically.
  + `author: `: Your name here!

- Example:

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../../images/rmdyaml2.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown - Text Blocks

- The text in the Markdown is going to be displayed as regular text.

- There are several ways to customize it.

- Headings:

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{../../images/rmdheadings.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown - Text Blocks

- The text in the Markdown is going to be displayed as regular text.

- Paragraphs:

```
This is my nice paragraph. It is going to look great!
```

- And you can write as much as you want in a paragraph. It is pretty much up to you.

## R Markdown - Text Blocks

- Paragraphs: another example:

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../../images/rmdpara1.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown - Text Blocks

- The text in the Markdown is going to be displayed as regular text.

- We are going to display: My work is **great**. It is *nice* to learn ***R Markdown***!

- **Bold**, *Italic*, and ***Bold + Italic***:

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{../../images/rmdpara2.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown - Text Blocks

- We can do ordered and unordered lists. Ordered start with numbers. Unordered start with a star (`*`) or dash (`-`). Lower levels are followed by `+`.

\tiny

```
Now I am going to build an unordered list:

- First element
- Second element
- Third element
  + Third-and-a-half element
  + Third-and-three-quarters element
  
And when I go shopping today, I am going to buy:

1. Rice
2. Beans
3. Soda (two types):
  + Diet coke
  + Sprite
4. Impossible burger
```

## R Markdown - Text Blocks

- And we can do nice and hard equations. 
  + But you would need to learn something called LaTeX to know how to do them.

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

- And an equation in the same line would be $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

- To do equations in the middle of the text, you should use two \$ signs (\$\$) to start and two \$ signs (\$\$) to end. 

- To do equations in-line, you should use one \$ signs (\$) to start and one \$ sign (\$) to end.

## R Markdown: Code chunks

- So far, we have used R Markdown as a text processor. But the power comes from the fact that we can do coding.

- To do in-line coding, we do the following:

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{../../images/rmdinlinecode.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-0.5cm}

- And it shows two plus two equals `r 2+2`.

- This symbol (\includegraphics[height=.04\textheight]{../../images/rmdtick1.png}) we call the tick mark. When you have one tick mark followed by r, it understands that it is R code (\includegraphics[height=.05\textheight]{../../images/rmdtick2.png}). 

- You should end with another tick mark: (\includegraphics[height=.06\textheight]{../../images/rmdtick3.png}).

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown: Code chunks

- But sometimes, we need big code chunks.

- Here is how we do those:

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../../images/rmdchunkexample.png}\end{center}

- You open with (\includegraphics[height=.06\textheight]{../../images/rmdchunkstart.png}) and close with (\includegraphics[height=.06\textheight]{../../images/rmdchunkend.png}). In the middle, as many code lines as you need.

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown: Code chunks

- And if you want to run your code chunks, you can use the little green play button.
  + It is located on the right-hand side of each of your chunks.

\begin{center} \includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{../../images/rmdlittleplay.png}\end{center}

\vspace{-2cm}

## R Markdown - Good Practices

**Good practices:**

1. Try to code clean: don't do all in one chunk. 
    + It is ok to alternate chunks with paragraphs of plain text. That's the purpose of R markdown!

\vspace{0.5cm}

2. Comment your code as if you were doing an R Script.
    + Remember, you will forget how you did, but you may need to do it again...
  
\vspace{0.5cm}

3. Always compile! It is not because you run the code and it works that your R Markdown will compile.
    + You should Knit before you submit.

\vspace{-0.5cm}

## R Markdown - Good Practices

**Good practices:**

4. As a general rule, never install packages on R Markdown:
    + It is going to get confused where is the place to download the package and will crash.

\vspace{0.5cm}

5. PDFs are great, DOCX is also good, but HTML is the best for beginner R coders.

\vspace{0.5cm}

6. The internet is an excellent source of help. 
    + Example, the [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).
