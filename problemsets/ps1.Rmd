# Problem Set 01 - Do Women Promote Different Policies than Men?

(Based on DSS Materials and on [Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo. 2004. ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India."](https://economics.mit.edu/files/792) *Econometrica*, 72 (5): 1409â€“43.)

We will estimate the average causal effect of having a female politician on two policy outcomes. For this purpose, we will analyze data from an experiment conducted in India, where villages were randomly assigned to have a female council head. The dataset we will use is in a file called "india.csv". The Table below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in this dataset, where the unit of observation is villages.

| **Variable** | **Description**                                                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| village      | village identifier ("Gram Panchayat number _ village number")                                    |
| female       | whether village was assigned a female politician: 1=yes, 0=no                                    |
| water        | number of new (or repaired) drinking water facilities in the village <br>since random assignment |
| irrigation   | number of new (or repaired) irrigation facilities in the village<br>since random assignment      |

In this problem set, we will practice loading, making sense of data, and understanding the basics of causal inference. We will also learn how to use R Markdown.

1. Use the function `read.csv()` to read the CSV file "india.csv". You can find it on the GitHub page: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/POLI30Dpublic/main/data/india.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umbertomig/POLI30Dpublic/main/data/india.csv). Use the assignment operator `<-` to store the data in an object called *india*. Provide the R code you used. (1 point)
