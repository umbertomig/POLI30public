# POLI 30 D

.font130[
* My mother-in-law, 65+ years old lady, was diagnosed with hep C.

* I did what any responsible in-law was supposed to do...

* The doctor was sure about her diagnostic: she told my wife that the test had an 80% accuracy (i.e., an 20% false-negative rate).

* But it turns out that the test she ran had a 50% false-positive rate.

* Now, spse of 1000 people that do the test, ten tests positive (1%). What are the chances that these people indeed have the disease?

|                       | test negative | test positive |
|-----------------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| does not have disease | .99*.5 = .495 | .99*.5 = .495 |
|           has disease | .01*.2 = .002 | .01*.8 = .008 |
