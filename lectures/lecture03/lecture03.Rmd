# Political Science Data

## What are Data/Datasets?
- To test theories, we need data. What is data? What are datasets?

- Datasets capture the characteristics of a particular set of individuals or entities: 
    + students, classrooms, schools, etc.
\vspace{.2cm}

- Datasets are typically organized as \concept{dataframes}\ where rows are observations and columns are variables\newline
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{\,\,}c@{\,\,}|c|c|c|c}
\multicolumn{1}{@{}c@{}}{}&\multicolumn{1}{@{}c@{}}{}& \multicolumn{3}{@{}c@{\,\,}}{variables}\\
\multicolumn{1}{@{}c@{}}{}&\multicolumn{1}{@{}c@{}}{}&

\cline{3-5}
\multicolumn{1}{r@{\,\,}}{...\,\,}&&&&&\\
\cline{3-5}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{-1.2cm}

## Example of a Dataframe
\begin{center}\includegraphics[height=.7\textheight]{../images/data3.png}\end{center}
\vspace{-1cm}

## What is an observation? 
- It is the information collected from a particular entity or individual in the study
\vspace{.2cm}

- The \concept{Unit of observation}\ of the dataset defines the individuals or the entities that each observation in the dataset represents
    + if the Unit of observation is students, each row in the dataset represents a different student
\vspace{.2cm}
    
- We usually refer to an observation by the row number in the dataset, which we denote as $i$
    + what is the first observation ($i$=1) in the dataframe above?
\vspace{-1cm}

## What is a variable?
- A variable contains the values of a changing characteristic for the various individuals or entities in the study
\vspace{.2cm}

- Every column of data in a dataset is a variable
    + if the Unit of observation is students, each variable captures a specific characteristic of the students, for all the students in the study
\vspace{.2cm}

- We usually refer to a variable by its name
    + *first\_name*, *test\_scores*

## Notation
- When defining new variables, we represent a variable and its contents in the following format:
\vspace{.3cm}
\begin{center} \textrm{\textit{X}} = \{10, 5, 8\}\end{center}

\vspace{.2cm}
- On the left-hand side of the equal sign, we identify the name of the variable: 
\vspace{.1cm}
    + what is the name of the variable here?
\vspace{.2cm}

- On the right-hand side of the equal sign and inside curly brackets, we have the content of the variable: multiple observations, separated by commas
\vspace{.1cm}
    + what are the observations in $X$?
  
\vspace{-1cm}

## Notation
\begin{center} \textrm{\textit{X}} = \{10, 5, 8\}\end{center}
\vspace{.6cm}

- To represent each observation we use \textit{X}$_i$
    + where $i$ stands for the observation number
    + the subscript $i$ means that we have a different value of \textit{X} for each value of $i$
    + what is \textit{X}$_3$?
\vspace{.2cm}

- The total number of observations is denoted as $n$
    + what does $n$ equal to here?    
\vspace{-1cm}  
  
## Types of Variables Based on Content
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.8\paperwidth}
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=white,linecolor=title, linewidth=0.05cm]
\vspace{.2cm}
\begin{center} \color{black}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [above] at (-1,10.3) {{variables}};
\draw (-1,10.3)--(-1,10.1);
\draw (-2,10.1)--(0,10.1);
\draw (-2,10.1)--(-2,10);

\draw (0,9.2)--(0,9);
\draw (-2,9)--(2,9);
\draw (-2,9)--(-2,8.9);
\draw (2,9)--(2,8.9);

\node [below] at (-2,9) {{binary}};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\vspace{.2cm}
\end{mdframed}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

## Character vs. Numeric
- \concept{Character variables}\ contain text
    + \textit{first\_names}=\{ana, elena, maria, ...\}
\vspace{.2cm}
    
- \concept{Numeric variables}\ contain numbers
    + \textit{test\_score}= \{80, 75, 99, ...\}
 
## Numeric: Binary variables (AKA dummy variables)
- \concept{Binary variables}\ can take only two values: 1s and 0s
\vspace{.2cm}

- They represent the presence/absence of a trait: 
    + 1 if individual $i$ has the trait
    + 0 if individual $i$ does not have the trait
\vspace{.2cm}

- Example: \textit{voted}= \{1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0\} where\newline
\vspace{-.1cm}
$$\textrm{\textit{voted}}_i = \begin{cases} 1 \text{ if individual \textit{i} voted} \\[3pt] 
0 \text{ if individual \textit{i} didn't vote} \end{cases}$$
\vspace{-.4cm}

- Can you think of another example?
\vspace{-1cm}

## Numeric: Non-binary variables
- \concept{Non-binary variables}\ can take more than two values
\vspace{.2cm}
    + \textit{distance}=\{1.452, 2.345, 0.298\}
    + \textit{dice\_roll}=\{2, 4, 6\}
\vspace{.2cm}

- Can you think of another example?

# Mean of a Variable

## Average or Mean of a Variable: \newline How to Compute it?
- Sum the values across all observations and divide the result by the total number of observations 

\vspace{-.5cm}
$$\overline{X} = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}{X_i}}{n} = \frac{X_1+X_2+...+X_n}{n}$$
\vspace{-.4cm} 

\begin{itemize}
\item $\overline{X}$ (pronounced X-bar) stands for the average of \textit{X}
\item $\sum^{n}_{i=1} X_i$ stands for the sum of all $X_i$ (observations of $X$) from $i$=1 to $i=n$, meaning from the first observation of the variable $X$ to the last one ($\sum$ is Greek letter sigma)
\item $X_i$ stands for a particular observation of $X$, where $i$ denotes the position of the observation and $n$ is the total number of observations in the variable
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-1cm}

***
- Example: if \textit{X}=\{10, 4, 6, 8, 22\}, then:
\vspace{.5cm}
    + $n$ = ?
    + $\overline{X}$ = ?
    + Let's compute it!
    \begin{eqnarray*}
\overline{X} = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}{X_i}}{n} &=& \pause \frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5}{5} \\[6pt] 
&=& \pause \frac{\textrm{10{+}4{+}6{+}8{+}22}}{\textrm{5}} = \pause \frac{\textrm{50}}{\textrm{5}}=\textrm{10}
\end{eqnarray*}

## Average or Mean of a Variable: \newline How to Interpret it?
- First, we need to figure out the quantity in which the value is measured
\vspace{.2cm}
    - Whenever interpreting numeric results, you should make it clear whether the number is measured in points, percents, miles, kilometers, etc.
\vspace{.2cm}
    - This is called the \concept{unit of measurement}


## Unit of Measurement of the Mean of a Variable
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=white,linecolor=titleline, linewidth=0.05cm]
\begin{center} \color{text}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node [above] at (0,10.3) {{interpretation of the mean of a variable}};
\draw (0,10.3)--(0,10.1);
\draw (-2.4,10.1)--(2.4,10.1);
\draw (-2.4,10.1)--(-2.4,10);
\draw (2.4,10.1)--(2.4,10);
\node [below] at (-2.4,10) {{\color{title}if variable is non-binary:}};
\node [below] at (-2.4,9.6) {{as an average, in the same}};
\node [below] at (-2.4,9.2) {{unit of measurement}};
\node [below] at (-2.4,8.8) {{as the variable}};

\node [below] at (2.4,10) {{\color{title}if variable is binary:}};
\node [below] at (2.4,9.6) {{as a proportion, in \%}};
\node [below] at (2.4,9.2) {{after multipying}};
\node [below] at (2.4,8.8) {{the result by 100}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{mdframed}


***
- When the variable is \concept{non-binary}, the mean should be interpreted as an average in the same unit of measurement as the values in the variable
\vspace{.2cm}

- Example: if \textit{X}=\{10, 4, 6, 8, 22\} and measured in miles
\vspace{.2cm}
    + $\overline{X}$ = ?
    + what type of variable is $X$ (binary or non-binary)?
    + shall we interpret $\overline{X}$ as an average or a proportion?
    + unit of measurement of $\overline{X}$ = 10?

***
- When the variable is \concept{binary}\, the mean should be interpreted as a proportion, in \% after multiplying the result by 100 
\vspace{.2cm}

+ Why? 
    + Because the mean of a binary variable is equivalent to the proportion of the observations that have the characteristic identified by the variable (i.e., that meet a criterion)

***
- Example: if \textit{X}=\{1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0\}, then:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overline{X} = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}{X_i}}{n} &=& \frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5 + X_6}{\textrm{6}} \\[3pt] 
&=& \pause \frac{\textrm{1{+}1{+}1{+}0{+}0{+}0}}{\textrm{6}} = \frac{\textrm{3}}{\textrm{6}}= \textrm{0.5} \pause
\end{eqnarray*}
\vspace{-.1cm}
    + what type of variable is $X$ (binary or non-binary)?
    + shall we interpret $\overline{X}$ as an average or a proportion?
    - interpretation of $\overline{X}$ = 0.5 (including units)? 
    \vspace{.1cm}
        + 50\% of the observations are 1s, that is, have the characteristic identified by $X$ (0.5x100=50\%)
    - note that the fraction $\frac{\textrm{3}}{\textrm{6}}$ is equivalent to the proportion of the observations that are 1s

***
- The proportion of observations in a variable that meet a criterion is calculated as:

\vspace{-.6cm}
$$\textrm{number of observations}$$
\vspace{-.6cm}
$$\frac{\textrm{that meet criterion}}{\textrm{total number of observations}}$$
\vspace{.2cm}

- Example: if \textit{X}=\{1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0\}, the proportion of observations in \textit{X} that are 1s is:
    \vspace{.2cm}
    + $\frac{\textrm{3}}{\textrm{6}}$= 0.50
    - to interpret the result of this fraction as a percentage, we multiply the decimal by 100 (0.50x100=50\%)
    - interpretation: 50\% of the observations in \textit{X} are 1s
